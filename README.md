# Italy-Visa-Experience

This is my visa experience for Long Term D-Type Employment Visa Process along with Declaration of Value. I later obtained the EU Blue card once I reached Italy through this visa.

# Brief of application process.

After I had received my offer letter, I was asked to obtain a declaration of value for my Master's degree so that I can get a EU Blue Card by being exceptionally skilled. To do this, I had to do the following :

## Process for Declaration of Value(DOV)

First, I needed to obtain my degree and transcript from the college. Then:

### Get degree and transcript attested from MHRD.
In order to get attestation from MHRD, you have to look up the procedure for your own respective state.
	The state from which you can apply for attestation can be either the state of your university or your college. I suggest you choose the state where you can easily get it done faster. After I spent, 15 days in getting attestation from Rajasthan, I realised you can get it from Telangana within two days by paying tatkal fees.
